Research on Safety Prediction of Sector Traffic Operation Based on Deep Learning
For Flight Conflicts Prediction

# Prologue
The average error of 10 trails shows that LSTM model with traffic parameters works better than LSTM model without traffic parameters. Then, we issue a comprehensive analysis of the relative predictive power of each of traffic parameters. The results illustrate that volume is the most important factor in promoting prediction accuracy and density has an advantage of improvement in the aspect of model stability.

# Environment

Python 3.7.9

Keras 2.3.1

For more detailed information about the model, you can refer to our paper.
