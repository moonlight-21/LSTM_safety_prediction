Research on Safety Prediction of Sector Traffic Operation Based on Deep Learning
For Flight Conflicts Prediction

# Prologue
We have verified the LSTM model does have the greatest prediction effect with comparison to other models. Next, in order to achieve the potential improvements for model performance and issue a comprehensive analysis of the relative predictive power of traffic parameter, the average error of 10 trails shows that LSTM model with traffic parameters works better than LSTM model without traffic parameters, which embodied in the prediction accuracy and model stability.

# Environment

Python 3.7.9

Keras 2.3.1

For more detailed information about the model, you can refer to our paper.
